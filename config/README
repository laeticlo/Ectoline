This directory contains Makefile machine specific configuration

These headers should be used with GNU-make (gmake)
or compatible

auto.conf : the main configuration file :
             - determine the machine port thru guess_port shell
             - include 'default.conf' file
             - include the machine specific '<port>.conf' file

default.conf : default configuration (included by 'auto.conf')

<port>.conf  : machine specific configuration (included by 'auto.conf')

makelib.targ : target for making libraries (included by libraries makefiles)

To check your port, issue :

  ./guess_port
  
  if output is 'unknown <mach>:<sys>:<rel>' then you should :
    - add a port entry in guess_port for <mach>:<sys>:<rel>
    - create a <port>.conf configuration file
      (the best is to start from another port file,
       choose whatever looks closest)
