  This distribution contains sources and pre-compiled binaries for Linux and
  MacOSX platforms.

  The binaries are located in PepLine/ports/<portname>/bin
  
  where <portname> is one of :

    i386-linux     : linux 32 bits  / compiled on linux RedHat - i386
    x386-linux     : linux 64 bits  / compiled on linux CentOS - x386
    i386-darwin    : macosX 32 bits / compiled on MacOSX INTEL (10.4)
    x386-darwin    : macosX 64 bits / compiled on MacOSX INTEL (10.10)

  To check your port, issue :

    config/guess_port
    if output is 'unknown <mach>:<sys>:<rel>' then see Annex 1 below

  To [re]compile for one of these ports or your newly added port :
  
      cd src; make
      
  Note: you need an ANSI C (e.g. gcc) compiler and a GNU compliant make.

  Note: for Windows, the compilation is a bit more tricky (we still need
        to provide a separate documentation for this port).
         
  Note: for MacOSX, to force compilation for another Mac port :
           make <portname> clean build  (<portname> = ppc-darwin or i386-darwin)
        e.g. on MacOSX Intel to force compiling for ppc, type :
           make ppc-darwin clean build
        There is no target yet for universal (fat) binaries (you
        should use lipo by hand).

  Once the compilation is finished, you may test the new binaries by issuing :
  
     make test
     
  At this point you may need to (re)compile PepNovo+ :
  
     cd ../thirdparty; make

  Finally, you may run the test suite 
  
     cd ../tests; ./runTests
  
  (Optionally) after the tests, you may want to cleanup the unnecessary files :

    cd ../src; make clean
    cd ../thirdparty; make clean
  
=============================
Annex 1
=============================

To configure and install the software on a *new* port (i.e. a port not listed above)

-a- cd to the 'config' directory

-b- issue './guess_port' to get your port name
    if the answer is 'unknown xx:yy:zz' then you need to edit the 'guess_port' script
    to add a new portname (try to keep the same convention : <CPU>-<SYSTEM>)
  
-c- if the <portname>.conf file does not exit, then you should create one.
    the best way is to start from the closest existing .conf file, to copy
    it and edit it to fit with your system.
    don't worry too much about cryptic flags, most of them are useless ;-)

-d- copy ./guess_port to ../scripts/LXGuessPort
